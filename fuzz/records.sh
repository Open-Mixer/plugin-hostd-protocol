# make fuzz-records: EVERY CHECK NAMES WHAT BREAKS IT. Each abort() of a harness, of its recorder and of fuzz/fuzz.h has
# in its comment a `mutant:` and `input:` record, a one-line change of the library and the seed on which that check
# aborts, or a `not a property:` line (fuzz/checks.awk, which refuses a check with neither). This applies each record
# alone, builds the plain harness (clang and libFuzzer, no sanitizer), runs it on the record's seed, and requires the
# abort of that check: exit status 134, and the abort() on the record's line. Built without the change, the same
# harness must exit 0 on every seed a record names. The changed file is restored from a copy on every exit path.
#
# To tell which abort() fired, the harness is built with a header that makes abort() name its file and line on
# standard error before it aborts; nothing else of the harness changes.
#
# Usage: FUZZ_BUILD=build/fuzz FUZZ_CC=clang records.sh
