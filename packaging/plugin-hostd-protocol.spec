%description
libplugin-hostd-protocol is the socket server, line protocol and command
dispatch that plugin-hostd and omx-clap-host answer their controllers with:
mod-host's text protocol, so any mod-host client works unchanged. A host
registers its plugin backend and the library listens on the command and
feedback ports, parses each command and sends the reply.
Its documentation is on openmixer.org.

%package devel
Summary: Build a host that answers the plugin-hostd protocol
Requires: %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description devel
Headers, the pkg-config file, the scenario corpus and its runner of
libplugin-hostd-protocol. The headers have the names and the API of
libmod-host-protocol's, so a host built against mod-host-protocol changes only
the package name it asks pkg-config for.
Its documentation is on openmixer.org.

It also carries the declared protocol: plugin-hostd/protocol.h and the headers
it includes, the one verb table, the grammar of a line in ABNF, and the
protocol as JSON, each named by a pkg-config variable.

%package contract
Summary: The plugin-hostd protocol's verbs in omx-contract's contract directory
BuildArch: noarch
Requires: (omx-contract >= 3.2.0 with omx-contract < 4)
# plugin-hostd before 0.16.0 declared the same items in its own package of the contract directory
Conflicts: plugin-hostd-contract < 0.16.0

%description contract
data/verbs.json of plugin-hostd-protocol, the verbs and reply codes
plugin-hostd adds to mod-host's protocol, as the package plugin-hostd-protocol
of omx-contract's contract directory, under
share/omx-contract/contract.d/3/plugin-hostd-protocol.
Its documentation is on openmixer.org.

%changelog
* Sun Nov 08 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.5.0-1
- curve_bind and curve_points: a display of an instance's panel description
  bound to the instance's parameters, and drawn from the values the instance
  holds at its rate by omx-dsp's omx_curve_points; codes -536 to -539
- host_dispatch_register_curve(): a host answers both over its backend and the
  rate it gives; one that does not answers -902
- codes -540 (durable-write-failed) and -541 (writer-queue-full) for the
  daemon's writer thread; history_clear, pin_clear and pin_accept declare them
- curve_points answers -542 (curve-value-not-finite) for a value that is not
  finite; a head filter's slope comes from its enumeration (@12|24)
- socket_adopt(): a host serves sockets its caller already bound; a second
  bind on the port is refused
- monitor_output_off <instance> <symbol> ends the monitor monitor_output set: a
  monitor ends with the connection that set it, an output this connection did
  not monitor is refused with -543 (output-not-monitored), and remove takes an
  instance's monitors with it
- host_dispatch_register_monitor_output_off(): the library keeps what each
  connection monitored and calls the host's end for an output that is ended, or
  left when the connection ends
- builds with omx-dsp-devel >= 0.32.0 and < 0.33

* Sat Nov 07 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.5-1
- show_external_ui and hide_external_ui are optional of every profile: the
  daemon sends each to the worker that holds the instance and passes its
  resp back; a daemon with no display session refuses both with -902
  hosting.window.no-display; the ledger keeps the latest of the two
* Sat Nov 07 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.4-1
- A second daemon on a busy port is refused instead of silently sharing it: the ports are
  opened with SO_REUSEADDR, never SO_REUSEPORT, so a port the daemon before left in
  TIME_WAIT is still taken again at once
* Fri Nov 06 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.3-1
- The descriptor name rule says bytes: each byte of an id's UTF-8 text
  outside [A-Za-z0-9._-] is one PHD_DESCRIPTOR_SAFE_CHAR, as plugin-hostd
  reads it and plugin-qualify now writes it
* Fri Nov 06 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.2-1
- The protocol page and protocol.h say how a pin is keyed: by its clap: uri's
  path decoded, so the uri written with the space as it is and written encoded
  name one pin; '%' is always an escape, and a name holding one writes it %25
* Fri Nov 06 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.1-1
- A path of a pin, and the path of a clap: uri, is written percent-encoded:
  a separator of pin_set, whitespace, '%', a quote, a backslash and a control
  byte are %XX, so any file name is one word. protocol.h declares the escape
  and phd_pin_path_encode() and phd_pin_path_decode()
- add: a clap: uri whose path holds a space and is written bare is one uri;
  phd_add_uri() is that reading, for every host that answers add
- phd_headless_qt(): with no display, a host gives Qt the offscreen platform
  unless the user set one, so a Qt-linked plugin (synthv1) does not abort
  as it is instantiated

* Fri Nov 06 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.4.0-1
- lv2_worker auto is no longer a word of the protocol: a plugin the chosen LV2
  worker refuses is answered with its code and never handed to another host.
  lv2_worker and lv2_worker_set take mod-host or omx-clap-host, and
  lv2_adapter_refused names omx-clap-host only
- pin_accept of a plugin whose pin carries verdict=refused (pins_dir or
  pin_file) is the user's choice to load it anyway, alone in a worker of its
  own; pin_clear takes it back; -516 is no longer its answer
- plugin_db_vocabulary.h is the render of plugin-db 0.2.0's words
* Wed Nov 04 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.3.0-1
- hello: the protocol version and the extensions a host grants; a client that
  sends no hello, or whose hello is refused, is answered as mod-host answers it
- Request tags, error words and event sequence numbers, each an extension a
  session asks for in its hello
- param_get_many and param_set_many: several values of one instance in one line,
  param_set_many all or nothing
- The default lv2_worker is omx-clap-host; mod-host runs an LV2 plugin only when
  named (#13)
- worker_list and plan: the core field reads -, a worker pinned to the whole
  audio set (#15)
- A track_info name is held to UTF-8 without C1 controls (#11); a word "..."
  where a pattern ends in "..." is an argument (#12)
- Fuzz harnesses with records, sabotage arms and a coverage floor run in CI
- The packages install their licence and a short README and no other markdown
- protocol_add_hello() and host_scenario_set_host() are the exported symbols added
- The words of a pin in protocol.h are the ones plugin-db declares
  (plugin_db_vocabulary.h, rendered from plugin-db 0.1.0's package)
- Dependencies carry a floor and a ceiling: omx-contract >= 3.9.0 and < 4 to
  build, >= 3.2.0 and < 4 to install the contract package

* Tue Nov 03 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.2.0-1
- protocol_parse() reads every form registered for a verb and runs the first whose
  arguments fit in number and type, so both forms of preset_show dispatch through the
  library (#5)
- The whole declared protocol moves here from plugin-hostd: plugin-hostd/protocol.h
  and the headers omx-contract renders for it, data/verbs.json,
  protocol/plugin-hostd.json and its schema, protocol/mod-host.json, and the
  generators and checks that keep them current
- One verb table, protocol/plugin-hostd-protocol.json: every command, each once,
  with its origin, its argument types, its reply and its refusals; a word of ours
  that changes a mod-host word is refused
- The grammar of a line in ABNF, generated from the table, and doc/protocol.md,
  generated from the table and the declarations; the scenario corpus and every
  reply of the golden transcript are held to the grammar
- New package plugin-hostd-protocol-contract: data/verbs.json as the package
  plugin-hostd-protocol of omx-contract's contract directory
- The library package installs the table, the grammar and the JSON of the
  protocol and of mod-host's, which programs read at run time; the devel package
  installs the headers under plugin-hostd/, the schema and the generator's
  source; pkg-config variables name each
- The library's exported symbols and types are those of 0.1.0

* Mon Nov 02 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 0.1.0-1
- First release: mod-host's socket server, line protocol and command dispatch
  (FreeMixer/mod-host 013ac7d, the code of mod-host-protocol 0.10.6-11.3) as a
  library of its own, the same API under the name plugin-hostd-protocol
- param_info writes NaN, Infinity and -Infinity for a value that is not finite,
  where it wrote past a stack array (plugin-hostd#371)
- a command whose first word is not a verb's no longer runs that verb's
  callback (plugin-hostd#372)
